/** This function is necessary inorder to use a method within a class as a function for an AWS Lambda function.
 *
 * If you were to instead directl call an instance method inside a handler youâ€™re likely to get an error.
 * It is a well known side effect of passing functions as value.
 * Because they are being used in isolation through dynamic binding, they lose the calling context.
 * Luckily, this can be easily solved with context binding:
